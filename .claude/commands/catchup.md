# Catch Up on Session Context

Read the session progress markdown file to understand what has been completed so far.

Look for files matching `*-progress.md` or `*-plan.md` in the repository root, and summarize:
1. What has been completed
2. What is currently in progress
3. What remains to be done
4. Any blockers or issues encountered

If no progress file exists, check git diff and recent commits to understand recent changes.
